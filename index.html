<h1 style="font-size: 80px; color: cornsilk;" >Talk about Depression</h1> 
<p id="p">Every  other person we meet around us is somehow going through an unpopular condition so called "Depresion"<br>
so what is Depression? what causes Depression? and on the top of every thing What are the final Consequence?<br>
.....
<br>Depression is the Mental State of a person who feels lonely ,betrayed ,lost and things is has no reasons to live for!!!!

<br>When you ask me aht is mainly cause depression is EXPECTATION.

<br>lets see from the prespective of a person who is depressed
<br>Our Subject name is say "Rakshita"

<br>Rakshita is a light hearted good person,she goes on happily with life and always making sure that people around her are happy,
prosperous and never make them hurt with any of her behaviour puts complete efforts to make them comfortable with her.<br>

<br><br>Any person like her expects world to same good and kind like herself,and thats when the spark of huge Mental Discomfort happens, Eventually leading to a taurmatic stituation 
called Depression<br><br>
<br>She believe and assumes that every one around her are good and gentle people and she goes on trusting people
<br>Thinking that these people will help her when she is in an helpless situation and these people will lean their shoulders for her!!!
<br>But World Is Cruel!
<br>They will be with her in her happy moments and leave her alone when she need someone to talk too

<br>They love her only of what they expect from her if she stops filling up their expectation, They will start ignoring her not even having 
<br>a small talk even when they come across huhh.(*tears*)

<br>She was always with all the closest people in their bad time but when she is going through a difficult unexplainable trauma she finds nobody is 
<br>to share thingd too
<br>then she reachs a mental condition where her mind says "Whats the use of having so many friends when they arent in you misrable time"
<br>but her Heart screams to be a nice person!! but how long she just expecting good from the world ,how long just hang up on hope!
<br><br><br>
<br>All at once She feels lonely even having so many friends and all those close people around her but cant explain a word to them
<br>What the point of having so many people when they cant understand you silence
<br>that brings her in a Pyschological Condition that happens to be Depression.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<o style="font-size: 50px; color: white ;">
So in the next Episode we will see
<br>
<br><br>What happens to Rakshita? 
<br><br>How will she overcome, where she feels lonley in this cruel world?<br><br>
What are the medication and behavioural changes she takes to come out of depression?
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Thank you!! </o>
